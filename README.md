Create a REST API to update, delete and retrieve countries from a list. Each country should be paired with a key, this being the Country Code (e.g. GB > United Kingdom)

We require the following methods:
- Retrieve a list of countries
- Retrieve a country (using country code)
- Add a country
- Remove a country

Once complete, please upload to a new git repository.
